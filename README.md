## Windows 10/11 Virtual Display Graphical Interface
Please note that I did not make the drivers nor do I own the images for this project.
Drivers are from www.amyuni.com

Commands need to be run with admin privileges or password.

Resolution for each vDisplay needs to be set manually.

For KH usage, 720p is recomended.

This graphical user interface runs the CMD commands for the amyuni drivers.

In the image below the first 3 displays are physical and the last 4 are virtual.
